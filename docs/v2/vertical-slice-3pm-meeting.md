## What's done

1. **v2 contract** (`src/shared/domain-v2.ts`) — full domain types incl. `Intervention`, `Ritual`, `CaptureEntry`, `Item.commitmentLevel`, `ItemPlan.relativeTo`. Shipped in commit `7d507db`.
2. **v2 store + fixture** (`src/renderer/state/store-v2.ts`) — seeded with the 3 PM 1:1 scenario: workspace, actors, sources, unmissable event item, ritual, prep task with `relativeTo` plan, three chained interventions (capture, torch, escalation). Activity log entries on every mutation.
3. **v2 selectors** (`src/renderer/state/selectors-v2.ts`) — `selectTodayItems`, `selectActiveInterventions`, `selectDailyFlow`, `selectPendingCaptureEntries`. Handles `relativeTo` derived timing.
4. **Dev clock** (`src/renderer/utils/dev-clock.ts` + `DevClockControl.tsx`) — bottom-right control with presets 14:54 / 14:55 / 14:59 / 15:00 / 15:01 + "resume" to return to real time.
5. **Brain-dump capture** — standalone Electron BrowserWindow (`src/main/windows/capture.ts` + `src/renderer/components/Intervention/CaptureWindow.tsx`). 600x480, always-on-top floating, visible across all macOS spaces.
6. **System torch** — full-screen Electron BrowserWindow (`src/main/windows/torch.ts` + `src/renderer/components/Intervention/TorchWindow.tsx`). Covers primary display, all spaces incl. over full-screen apps, cursor-tracking spotlight.
7. **Escalation banner** (`EscalatedBanner.tsx`) — top-banner stand-in for what would be a push notification.
8. **InterventionLayer** (`InterventionLayer.tsx`) — reads v2 store + dev clock, auto-activates scheduled-but-due interventions, routes the highest-intensity one to the right surface via IPC. Listens for close events and updates the store.
9. **Removed**: debug-only `V2TodayIsland` + the in-window `ModalCapture` (superseded by the standalone window).

## What's open

1. **Step 8 — user verification.** Walk the scenario, report what you see and feel. **Blocked**: requires a full app restart to pick up new main-process + preload code (see Troubleshooting).
2. **Open product questions** logged at the bottom — auto-resolve capture when preempted by torch, mouse-capture vs click-through for torch, escalation timer trigger, etc.
3. **Future** (not in this slice): multi-display torch, real push for escalation, real calendar sync, multi-actor, SQLite persistence, AI-suggested rituals, mouse-as-flashlight across other apps with click-through.

---

## Goal

Build the first end-to-end product moment using the v2 contract: an unmissable 3 PM meeting, a pre-meeting capture ritual, a brain-dump surface, and a torchlight intervention that draws the user out of focus into the next commitment.

**Success criterion:** walking through the scenario in the running Electron app (with a simulated dev clock) and feeling whether the loop is calm but uncompromising. Each step writes through v2 store actions and produces correct `ActivityLog` entries.

---

## Status pointer

▸ **Step 11 done; Step 8 still open.** Timing bug fixed (dev clock now defaults to 14:54 so interventions don't fire on app load). Multi-display torch + system notification + hero banner all wired. User to verify with a fresh `npm start`.

(When resuming: update this line first, before doing any other work.)

### Step 11 — Multi-surface attention + timing fix (added 2026-05-26, done)

User feedback after Step 10:
1. The torch was firing on app open instead of when the dev clock advanced — root cause: real-time `Date.now()` was already past the seeded UTC times (14:55, 14:59), so the activation filter immediately caught them.
2. Torch needed to appear on every display, not just primary.
3. Attention needed to be multi-surface — torch + macOS native notification + hero banner across the top of the screen — not just one overlay.

Fixed:

- **Dev clock initial state** (`src/renderer/utils/dev-clock.ts`): defaults to `${TODAY}T14:54:00.000Z` (before any scheduled intervention). Real time is never the source unless the user explicitly resumes.
- **Multi-display torch** (`src/main/windows/torch.ts`): iterates `screen.getAllDisplays()` and opens one transparent overlay per display. Cursor naturally drives the spotlight on whichever display the user is on.
- **macOS native notification**: `Notification.show()` with `urgency: 'critical'` and the same title/subtitle. Clicking the notification routes to the same dismiss path as the torch CTA.
- **Hero banner** (`src/renderer/components/Intervention/HeroBannerWindow.tsx` + `.css`, `?mode=hero-banner` route): a slim 64px-tall window across the top of the focused display, urgent-colored, with a "Got it" CTA. `screen.getDisplayNearestPoint(screen.getCursorScreenPoint())` decides which display gets the banner.
- All three surfaces share one `correlationId`. Dismissing any one (click banner CTA, click torch CTA, click system notification, or click the InterventionLayer's wiring) closes everything via `hideTorch()`.

Architectural notes:

- The hero banner window is `focusable: false` so it doesn't steal keyboard focus from whatever the user was doing.
- The system notification uses Electron's built-in `Notification` API. In dev, macOS may show a one-time permission prompt the first time; in production, the app must be code-signed.
- The "focused display" heuristic uses cursor position. If the user wants a stricter "active window's display" later, that needs accessibility permissions; current heuristic is sufficient.
- `findMainAppWindow()` in `src/main/ipc/index.ts` now excludes the hero-banner mode URL too, so IPC routing stays correct.

## Troubleshooting (added 2026-05-26)

### Symptom: clicking a dev-clock preset does nothing

**Most likely cause:** Electron main-process and preload code are loaded only at startup. Vite's hot-reload covers the renderer but NOT the main process and NOT the preload. If `npm start` was running before commits `7d507db` (intervention contracts), `ed22b05` (v2 store), `4566c61` (in-window slice), `d59caa7` (system torch), or `dc172a7` (capture window), then the running Electron has old main + old preload code. The renderer can call `window.api.torch.show(...)` but main has no handler, OR `window.api.torch` is undefined entirely because preload didn't expose it.

**Fix:**
1. Cmd-Q the app (fully quit, not just close the window).
2. From `/Users/groot/dev/needle`, run `npm start` again.
3. Open DevTools (View → Developer → Toggle Developer Tools, or Cmd+Option+I).
4. Click the **14:59** preset on the dev clock (bottom-right).
5. If nothing happens, check the console for errors and paste them.

### Quick manual sanity check

In DevTools console:

```js
window.api?.torch?.show({ correlationId: 'manual-test', title: 'TEST', subtitle: 'manual', durationMs: 5000 });
```

- If the torch overlay appears: the IPC + window plumbing works, the bug is in InterventionLayer's activation logic.
- If `window.api` or `window.api.torch` is `undefined`: preload is stale or didn't load.
- If the call returns but no window opens: main-process IPC handler is missing (stale main).

Same for capture:

```js
window.api?.capture?.show({ correlationId: 'manual-test', title: 'TEST', subtitle: 'manual' });
```

### Step 9 — System-level torch (added 2026-05-26, done)

User feedback after Step 7: the torch must be a full-system overlay, not just inside the main window. Wherever the user is on their mac, the torch appears.

Implemented:

- `src/main/windows/torch.ts` — `showTorch(payload)` opens a transparent, frameless BrowserWindow covering the primary display's bounds. `alwaysOnTop('screen-saver')`, `setVisibleOnAllWorkspaces(true, { visibleOnFullScreen: true })`, `skipTaskbar`, `fullscreenable: false`. Loads the renderer with `?mode=torch`.
- `src/main/ipc/index.ts` — handlers for `torch:show`, `torch:hide`, `torch:dismiss`. The dismiss handler forwards `torch:closed` to the main-app window and closes the torch window.
- `src/shared/ipc-contracts.ts` — `TorchShowPayload`, `TorchDismissReason`, `TorchClosePayload` types with a `correlationId` so the main-app renderer can match the close back to the originating intervention.
- `src/preload/index.ts` + `src/renderer/window.d.ts` — `window.api.torch.{show, hide, dismiss, onPayload, onClosed}`.
- `src/renderer/main.tsx` — checks `?mode=torch` query, mounts either `<App />` or `<TorchWindow />`. Adds `body.torch-mode` class so torch-only CSS doesn't leak into the main app.
- `src/renderer/components/Intervention/TorchWindow.tsx` + `.css` — full-window component that listens for `torch:payload`, tracks `mousemove`, renders `Torchlight` with a cursor-driven spotlight. Cursor IS the torch.
- `Torchlight.tsx` extended — added `cursor?: { x, y, radius }` prop, `showCta`, `timeoutMs`. In cursor mode the spotlight follows the mouse via inline mask updates.
- `InterventionLayer.tsx` rewritten — for `attention_takeover_torch`, fires `window.api.torch.show()` (an effect tracks the active torch id and hides on transition). Listens for `torch:closed` and routes to `resolveIntervention` (acknowledged) or `escalateIntervention` (timeout).

Architectural notes:

- Mouse is captured by the torch window (not click-through). The user cannot interact with apps underneath until they dismiss. Trade-off: "uncompromising attention" vs "cursor-following-everywhere distraction." Acceptable for the first cut.
- Primary display only. Multi-display extension is a follow-up: iterate `screen.getAllDisplays()` and open a torch window per display, share the same correlationId, dismiss all on first acknowledge.
- The CSS for torch transparency is scoped by `body.torch-mode` so the main window keeps its normal opaque background.
- Vite verified to bundle main + preload + renderer cleanly.

### Step 10 — Brain-dump capture as standalone always-on-top window (done)

User feedback after Step 7: the in-window modal capture should also be a standalone always-on-top window, like the torch. Plus: the debug "v2 slice" island below QuickAdd was confusing and is not product UI — removed.

Implemented:

- `src/main/windows/capture.ts` — `showCapture(payload)` opens a transparent, frameless, 600x480 BrowserWindow centered horizontally and one-third down on the primary display. `alwaysOnTop('floating')`, visible on all workspaces incl. full-screen, `skipTaskbar`, `focusable: true` (so the textarea can receive keystrokes). Loads renderer with `?mode=capture`.
- `src/main/ipc/index.ts` — handlers for `capture:show`, `capture:hide`, `capture:add-entry`, `capture:promote-entry`, `capture:dismiss-entry`, `capture:close`. All forwarded to the main-app window for store updates.
- `src/shared/ipc-contracts.ts` — capture payload types with a `correlationId` that pairs every event back to the originating intervention.
- `src/preload/index.ts` + `src/renderer/window.d.ts` — `window.api.capture.{show, hide, addEntry, promoteEntry, dismissEntry, close, onPayload, onEntryAdded, onEntryPromoted, onEntryDismissed, onClosed}`.
- `src/renderer/main.tsx` — `?mode=capture` routes to `<CaptureWindow />`. Sets `body.capture-mode` so capture-only CSS does not leak.
- `src/renderer/components/Intervention/CaptureWindow.tsx` + `.css` — full-window component with a local entry list (raw / promoted / dismissed). Emits IPC for each user action.
- `InterventionLayer.tsx` updated — for `modal_capture`, fires `window.api.capture.show(...)`. Listens for capture entry events and routes them to v2 store actions (`addCaptureEntry`, `promoteCaptureEntry`, `dismissCaptureEntry`). On close, calls `resolveIntervention` with the right outcome.
- Removed `ModalCapture.tsx` + `.css` — no longer used.
- Removed `V2TodayIsland.tsx` + `.css` — was a debug surface; not product UI.

Architectural notes:

- The capture window is sized to the card itself, so clicking outside the window naturally uses other apps — no click-through magic needed.
- State authority stays in the main-app renderer (the v2 store). The capture window holds local-only entry state for its own UI; canonical writes happen in the main window via IPC.
- A small map (`entryIdMap`) in InterventionLayer translates the capture window's local entry ids into the v2 store's `CaptureEntryId`s, so promote/dismiss reach the right rows.

Architecture:
- New Electron BrowserWindow created on demand by main process.
- Properties: `transparent: true`, `frame: false`, `alwaysOnTop` at `'screen-saver'` level, `setVisibleOnAllWorkspaces(true, { visibleOnFullScreen: true })`, `skipTaskbar: true`, `fullscreenable: false`, `focusable: true`, `resizable: false`, covers the primary display's full bounds.
- Mouse is captured (NOT click-through). The user cannot interact with other apps until they dismiss. That is the "take the user's attention" experience.
- Cursor IS the torch — spotlight follows `mousemove` on the overlay. Matches the user's original brainstorm.
- 30s timer fires `escalateIntervention` if the user does not dismiss.
- Single primary display for v1; multi-display TODO.

Reuses the existing renderer bundle with a `?mode=torch` URL flag — `src/renderer/main.tsx` checks the query string and mounts either `<App />` or `<TorchWindow />`. No new Vite entry needed.

New IPC channels (`src/shared/ipc-contracts.ts`):
- `torch:show` (renderer → main): `{ title, subtitle, durationMs }` — open the window.
- `torch:hide` (renderer → main): force-close (e.g. when the source intervention is cancelled).
- `torch:payload` (main → torch renderer): pushes title/subtitle/durationMs into the torch window after it loads.
- `torch:dismiss` (torch renderer → main): user clicked CTA OR the timer elapsed. Reason: `'acknowledged' | 'timeout'`.
- `torch:closed` (main → main-app renderer): forwarded after the torch window closes, so InterventionLayer can call `resolveIntervention` / `escalateIntervention`.

### Progress log

- 2026-05-26 — Steps 1-4 complete (planning doc, store + fixture, selectors, dev clock).
  - `src/renderer/state/store-v2.ts` — fixture + actions; clean typecheck + lint.
  - `src/renderer/state/selectors-v2.ts` — `selectTodayItems` / `selectActiveInterventions` / `selectDailyFlow` / `selectPendingCaptureEntries`. Handles `relativeTo` derived timing.
  - `src/renderer/utils/dev-clock.ts` — zustand-based frozen-time singleton; `nowIso()` reads frozen or real.
  - `src/renderer/components/DevTools/DevClockControl.tsx` — floating preset jumper (14:54 / 14:55 / 14:59 / 15:00 / 15:01 + resume).
  - Not yet mounted in `App.tsx` / `TodayScreen.tsx` — wiring deferred to Step 7.
  - Committed as `ed22b05`.
- 2026-05-26 — Step 5 complete (modal capture).
  - `src/renderer/components/Intervention/ModalCapture.tsx` + `.css` — props are `{ intervention, entries, onClose }`; uses `useV2Store` for `addCaptureEntry` / `promoteCaptureEntry` / `dismissCaptureEntry` / `resolveIntervention`. Cmd/Ctrl+Enter commits a draft. Closing with entries records `completed`; closing empty records `dismissed`. Locks body scroll while open.
  - Typecheck + lint clean.
- 2026-05-26 — Step 6 complete (torchlight overlay, via background subagent).
  - `src/renderer/components/Intervention/Torchlight.tsx` + `.css` — self-contained, no store dependency.
  - Decision the agent made: `mask-image` + radial-gradient on a single backdrop element (not SVG, not clip-path). Reason: masked-out regions render nothing — neither dim nor blur leaks into the spotlight. Mask transitions get smooth slide for free.
  - Spotlight follows `targetRect`: center on rect, radius = `max(w,h) * 0.8 + 60`. Falls back to viewport center @ 200px when null.
  - 30s auto-timeout via `useRef` to avoid resetting the timer on callback identity changes.
  - `prefers-reduced-motion` disables transitions.
  - Concerns flagged: no portal — parent must mount near root or a transformed ancestor will break z-index escape (handled in Step 7: mounted in App.tsx).
- 2026-05-26 — Token migration patch.
  - The new components referenced `--surface-raised` / `--border-subtle` / `--surface-hover` / `--border-default` which were target names in `design/tokens.md` but not yet defined.
  - Added them as aliases in `src/renderer/styles/tokens.css` for both light and dark themes (mapped per the migration table in `design/tokens.md`).
  - Fixed token names in `DevClockControl.css` and `ModalCapture.css` to use the project's step-based scale (`--space-3`, `--text-13`, `--radius-3` etc.) instead of pixel-named tokens.
- 2026-05-26 — Step 7 complete (wiring).
  - `src/renderer/components/Intervention/InterventionLayer.tsx` — reads `useV2Store` + `useDevClock`, derives surfacing interventions (active OR scheduled-but-due), auto-activates the scheduled-but-due ones via `useEffect`, routes the highest-intensity one to the right component by strategy. Re-measures the torch's target rect on resize/scroll/500ms interval.
  - `src/renderer/components/Intervention/EscalatedBanner.tsx` + `.css` — top banner stand-in for what would be a push notification.
  - `src/renderer/components/Intervention/V2TodayIsland.tsx` + `.css` — renders the v2 prep + meeting items so the torch has a DOM target (`data-v2-item-id`). Also shows captured-but-unpromoted entries inline.
  - Mounted `<InterventionLayer />` and `<DevClockControl />` in `App.tsx` (top-level, no transformed ancestors).
  - Mounted `<V2TodayIsland />` inside `TodayScreen` between QuickAddRow and UpcomingFooter.
  - Typecheck + lint clean.

### Dry-run trace (what should happen)

| Clock | Surfacing | Renders | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| live (not jumped) | none | dev clock + v2 island only | — |
| 14:54 | none | same | — |
| 14:55 | capture (was scheduled) | ModalCapture | `activateIntervention` runs, status=active. User types thoughts → `addCaptureEntry`. "Promote to task" → new `Item`. "Done" → `resolveIntervention(outcome='completed')`. |
| 14:59 | torch (now due) | Torchlight pointing at Manager 1:1 row | `activateIntervention(torch)`. User clicks CTA → `resolveIntervention(outcome='acknowledged')`. If no click for 30s → `escalateIntervention` activates the chained `escalated_alert`. |
| 15:00 (no ack) | escalation | EscalatedBanner | User dismisses → `resolveIntervention(outcome='acknowledged')`. |

Every transition writes `ActivityLog` rows attributed to the correct actor (user vs system).

---

## Scope

### In

- v2 store + fixture seeding the 3 PM meeting scenario.
- Selectors that produce `TodayItemView[]` + `DailyFlowView` with `activeInterventions`.
- Simulated dev clock (jump to 14:54, 14:55, 14:59, 15:00, 15:01).
- Modal capture surface — fires from `modal_capture` intervention, writes `CaptureEntry[]`.
- Torchlight overlay — fires from `attention_takeover_torch` intervention, dim/blur + spotlight on next item.
- Store actions: `scheduleIntervention`, `activateIntervention`, `resolveIntervention`, `escalateIntervention`, `addCaptureEntry`, `promoteCaptureEntry`.
- Acknowledge / dismiss flow → `InterventionOutcome` recorded.
- `ActivityLog` entries for every guidance-related write.

### Out (deferred)

- Real calendar sync (use manual seeded `ItemOccurrence`).
- Real system notifications / push (in-app surface only this slice).
- AI-suggested rituals (manual ritual only; AI suggestion flow comes later).
- Subtasks-as-child-items migration (Phase C, separate slice).
- Multi-actor / sharing.
- Persistence to SQLite (still in-memory fixture; Ring 1 work).
- Mouse-as-flashlight tracking (v1 torchlight uses fixed spotlight over target item).

---

## Decisions locked

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Vertical-slice approach over bottom-up Phase B | Velocity + learning whether the loop feels right; data model is solid enough to commit. |
| Slice reads/writes through v2 selectors and actions only | Avoids throwaway work; remaining Today rows port to the same selectors later. |
| Rest of Today UI keeps legacy `Task` store for now | Slice is additive, not a migration. |
| Simulated dev clock for development | Real `useNow()` hook comes after the loop is validated. |
| Torchlight = CSS radial-gradient spotlight + backdrop dim/blur | Standard CSS, no mouse-tracking in v1. |
| Spotlight follows the target item card via DOMRect ref | Predictable + accessible; mouse-as-flashlight is a v2 enhancement. |
| Modal capture is non-blocking but unmissable-aware | Closing without input records `dismissed` outcome on the intervention. |
| Escalation in this slice = in-app banner | Real push needs device registration; deferred. |

## Step-by-step plan

### Step 1 — Planning doc — DONE
This file. Living doc, updated per step.

### Step 2 — v2 fixture + store skeleton — NEXT
- New file: `src/renderer/state/store-v2.ts`.
- Seeds:
  - One `Workspace`, one `User`, one `Actor(kind='user')` for Ofer, one `Actor(kind='ai_agent')`, one `Actor(kind='integration')` for calendar.
  - One `Source(kind='manual')`, one `Source(kind='calendar')`.
  - 3 PM 1:1 `Item(kind='event', commitmentLevel='unmissable')` + matching `ItemOccurrence`.
  - One `Ritual(kind='pre_meeting_capture')`, trigger `before_occurrence -5 min`, actions `[open_capture, fire_intervention(attention_takeover_torch, screen_overlay, intensity=4, offsetMinutes=-1)]`.
  - Materialized prep `Item(kind='task')` + `ItemRelation(prep_for)` + `ItemPlan(mode='anchor', relativeTo={occ, -5})`.
  - Two scheduled `Intervention` rows: modal_capture at 14:55, torch at 14:59.
- Branded ID helpers (factory functions that mint UUIDs).
- Store actions stubbed:
  - `scheduleIntervention(input)` → adds + `activity_log`.
  - `activateIntervention(id)` → status=active, activatedAt=now.
  - `resolveIntervention(id, outcome)` → status, outcome, resolvedAt, `activity_log`.
  - `escalateIntervention(id)` → sets `escalatesToInterventionId`, fires the next.
  - `addCaptureEntry(input)` → adds + `activity_log`.
  - `promoteCaptureEntry(id)` → creates `Item(kind='task')`, sets entry.status=`promoted` + promotedItemId, `activity_log`.
- Verify: typecheck passes; fixture exports a non-empty initial state.

### Step 3 — v2 selectors
- New file: `src/renderer/state/selectors-v2.ts`.
- `selectTodayItems(state, actorId, date, now)` → `TodayItemView[]` including resolved-time for `relativeTo` plans, `pendingInterventions` per item, child progress.
- `selectActiveInterventions(state, actorId, now)` → `Intervention[]` where `status === 'scheduled' && scheduledFor <= now` OR `status === 'active'`.
- `selectPendingCaptureEntries(state, actorId)` → `CaptureEntry[]` where `status === 'raw'`.
- `selectDailyFlow(state, actorId, date, now)` → `DailyFlowView`.
- Verify with dev-mode logs at simulated times 14:54 (no intervention), 14:55 (modal_capture active), 14:59 (torch active), 15:01 (resolved or missed).

### Step 4 — Simulated dev clock
- New util: `src/renderer/utils/dev-clock.ts` — singleton with `now()` that returns either real `Date.now()` or a frozen scrubbable time.
- Floating dev control: "Jump to 14:54 / 14:55 / 14:59 / 15:00 / 15:01" + "Resume real time".
- Visible only when an env flag or dev-menu toggle is on.

### Step 5 — Modal capture surface — PARALLELIZABLE WITH STEP 6
- New components: `src/renderer/components/Intervention/ModalCapture.tsx` + CSS.
- Renders when `activeIntervention.strategy === 'modal_capture'`.
- Multiline input → on submit → `store.addCaptureEntry(body)`; chip list of previous entries; "Promote to task" per chip → `store.promoteCaptureEntry(id)`.
- Close button → `store.resolveIntervention(id, entries > 0 ? 'completed' : 'dismissed')`.
- Calm visual: subtle scrim, centered card, no urgency markers.

### Step 6 — Torchlight overlay surface — PARALLELIZABLE WITH STEP 5
- New components: `src/renderer/components/Intervention/Torchlight.tsx` + CSS.
- API (self-contained, no store dependency):
  ```ts
  type Props = {
    active: boolean;
    title: string;
    subtitle: string;
    targetRect: DOMRect | null;  // where the spotlight goes
    onAcknowledge: () => void;
    onTimeout: () => void;        // fires after 30s without acknowledge
  };
  ```
- Full-screen fixed overlay; dim/blur backdrop via CSS `backdrop-filter`; radial-gradient spotlight positioned over `targetRect`.
- Single CTA "I'm moving to it" → `onAcknowledge()`.
- 30s timer → `onTimeout()` if no ack.

### Step 7 — Wire InterventionLayer into TodayScreen
- New: `src/renderer/components/Intervention/InterventionLayer.tsx` — picks the right component by `intervention.strategy`.
- `TodayScreen` reads `selectDailyFlow(...)`, mounts `<InterventionLayer />` at the top.
- Target rect for torch is captured by giving the target item card a ref-forwarding wrapper.

### Step 8 — End-to-end walk-through
- Run the app. Step the simulated clock through 14:54 → 14:55 → 14:59 → 15:00 → 15:01.
- Verify:
  - 14:54: no intervention active.
  - 14:55: modal capture fires; entries can be added + promoted.
  - 14:59: torch fires (capture already resolved or still open?  — decide UX during walk-through).
  - 15:00: if not acknowledged, status becomes `escalated`; next intervention (in-app banner stand-in for push) fires.
  - 15:01: meeting is in-progress; remaining interventions cancel.
- Take screenshots / notes per surface.

### Step 9 — Activity log spot-check
- After the walk-through, dump every `ActivityLog` row written. Confirm each guidance-related action has `actorId`, before/after, and a sensible `action` verb.

### Step 10 — Wrap
- Update `docs/v2/implementation-roadmap.md` Phase B note: vertical slice complete, fixture pattern proven.
- Update this doc's Status pointer to "Complete".
- Commit incrementally; PR or push at end.

## Parallel orchestration plan

Where work is genuinely independent and the subagent's cold-start cost is amortized by parallelism:

**Steps 5 (modal capture) + 6 (torchlight)** run in parallel once Step 4 is done.

- **Subagent A — Torchlight overlay.** Self-contained presentational component with the API in Step 6. No knowledge of the data model required. Tight brief: build component + CSS + a small demo page that exercises the API.
- **Main thread — Modal capture.** Needs the v2 store to write `CaptureEntry`s and resolve interventions, so it stays on the main thread.

**Merge point:** Step 7. Main thread wires both components into `InterventionLayer` and connects them to the store.

Other steps are tightly sequential (fixture → selectors → wiring) and not worth splitting.

---

## Open questions

Captured as they arise; resolved before they block.

- If the user doesn't resolve the modal capture before 14:59, the torch (higher intensity) preempts it visually. The capture intervention stays `status='active'` in the store — should it auto-resolve to `dismissed`/`completed` when preempted? Acceptable wart for the slice; revisit after the user walks through the scenario.
- The InterventionLayer activates scheduled-but-due interventions inside a `useEffect`. If multiple slice scenarios run in real-time (not frozen), the effect re-runs as `now` ticks. The early-return on empty `scheduledDueIds` keeps it harmless. Real-time ticking is not part of this slice — `useNow` integration is later.
- Torch currently **captures mouse** (not click-through). The user cannot use other apps until they dismiss. Uncompromising. Might want a setting / `intensity`-driven toggle to allow click-through at lower intensities.
- Hero banner currently fires only on the **focused** display (cursor heuristic). User asked "focused OR all" — needs a product call which we choose at fire time.
- Hero banner uses the **urgent red** accent. May feel too aggressive for non-critical reminders; revisit per `commitmentLevel`.
- System notification currently uses `urgency: 'critical'` and is non-silent. May want to tune per intervention strategy / commitment level.

## Discussion log

Captured for continuity. Each entry is a turn-level summary of why a decision was made.

### 2026-05-26 — Pre-Phase-B data-modeling pass

User asked to make the v2 data model bulletproof before building selectors. Walked through the concrete product moments the user cares about (3 PM meeting, brain-dump 5 min before, torchlight nudge, escalation across devices). Identified four real gaps in the existing v2 contract:

- No relative/derived timing (couldn't model "5 min before this meeting").
- No first-class concept for attention strategy + lifecycle (interventions were going to disappear into `metadata` blobs).
- No standing rules that generate prep work per matching occurrence (rituals).
- No structured capture stream during a transition (`Reflection.followUpItemId` was singular).

Locked: `Intervention`, `Ritual`, `CaptureEntry` as first-class entities; `Item.commitmentLevel` and `ItemPlan.relativeTo` as extensions. Free-array `Ritual.actions`. Commitment level on `Item` only for MVP. AI suggests, user authors — both flows attributed via `createdByActorId`.

### 2026-05-26 — Vertical slice over bottom-up Phase B

Offered two paths: (A) build Phase B fixture + selectors against the existing UI, then layer in product moments; (B) take one concrete scenario (3 PM meeting) and build it end-to-end against the v2 contract. User chose B. Reasoning: data model already solid enough to commit; risk is no longer wrong model, risk is spending sessions on plumbing before learning whether the loop feels right.

Constraint: the slice must read/write through v2 selectors and store actions only, so finishing Phase B later is just porting remaining rows onto the same selectors.

### 2026-05-26 — Torch must be a system-level surface

After the in-window torch landed, user said: must cover the full mac system, across all spaces, including over full-screen apps. Moved torchlight from an in-window React overlay to a separate transparent Electron `BrowserWindow` (`alwaysOnTop('screen-saver')`, `setVisibleOnAllWorkspaces(true, { visibleOnFullScreen: true })`). Cursor-tracking spotlight inside the window. Single primary display first.

### 2026-05-26 — Capture should also be standalone always-on-top

Symmetric request after the torch landed. Promoted the brain-dump modal to its own floating Electron window (smaller, sized to the card, `alwaysOnTop('floating')`). Also removed the debug-only "v2 slice" island from Today because it was confusing once both intervention surfaces became separate windows.

### 2026-05-26 — Confusion about the v2 island + dev clock

User saw the debug v2 island and the dev clock and didn't understand what they were. Walked through what each piece is (debug surface vs developer tool vs product UI), removed the island, kept the dev clock with clearer presets. Status pointer updated.

### 2026-05-26 — Torch didn't appear on first walk-through

User clicked the dev clock and nothing happened. Two root causes:

1. **Stale main process**: Electron does not hot-reload main + preload. Needed a full Cmd-Q + `npm start`. Added defensive `window.api?.torch` checks + `console.warn` so future stale-process states are visible in DevTools.
2. **Real-time bug**: seeded `scheduledFor` times (14:55, 14:59 UTC) were already past `Date.now()`, so every intervention immediately surfaced on app open. Fixed by defaulting the dev clock to `${TODAY}T14:54:00.000Z`. Real time is never the source unless the user explicitly clicks "resume."

### 2026-05-26 — Multi-surface attention

User clarified that the torch alone is not enough — wants the moment to feel like the whole mac is helping the user move. Implemented three surfaces firing concurrently with one `correlationId`:

- Torch overlay on **every connected display** via `screen.getAllDisplays()`.
- macOS native `Notification` (urgency `critical`, click routes to dismiss the chain).
- Slim hero banner across the top of the **focused display** (cursor-determined via `screen.getDisplayNearestPoint(screen.getCursorScreenPoint())`).

Dismissing any one closes everything via `hideTorch()`.

## Backlog / next-todo

Captured for the next session(s). Not in scope for the current slice.

### Mouse cursor as a "fire" / OS-wide cursor effect when time runs out

Idea: when the user is over their commitment time (e.g. meeting started, no dismiss), morph the system mouse pointer into something visceral — flame trail, burning cursor, ember sparks. The cursor follows the user across other apps too, so the urgency comes with them.

Investigation notes for whoever picks this up:

- **Pure visual overlay (no system cursor change)** — easiest path. A transparent always-on-top Electron `BrowserWindow` that's `setIgnoreMouseEvents(true, { forward: true })` so clicks pass through to other apps. Main process polls `screen.getCursorScreenPoint()` at ~30-60Hz and broadcasts to the overlay window. The window renders a fire/ember trail that follows the cursor. Works without any special permission. Does NOT change the actual OS cursor shape — instead, a trail follows behind/around it.
- **Replacing the actual macOS cursor shape** — much harder. Standard macOS `NSCursor` APIs only affect cursor inside your own app's windows. Changing the cursor in other apps requires either:
  - A native module loading private CoreGraphics APIs (`CGSSetSystemCursor`) — fragile, version-dependent, likely AppStore-rejected.
  - Accessibility permission (System Preferences → Privacy & Security → Accessibility) — grants the ability to inject events and read other windows, but **does not** give cursor-shape control directly. Useful for related effects (e.g. dimming other windows) but not the cursor itself.
- **Recommended first cut**: the pure visual overlay. Reuse the torch BrowserWindow infrastructure — add a new `cursor_effect` Electron window strategy that polls cursor position and renders a fire trail. Trigger when the torch's 30s timer elapses without acknowledge (the same path that today fires `escalateIntervention`).
- **`Intervention` shape supports this already** — add `cursor_effect_fire` to `InterventionStrategy` and `screen_overlay` surface. No schema changes needed.

Other backlog items:

- Multi-display hero banner (currently focused-display only).
- Torch click-through mode for lower-intensity interventions.
- Auto-resolve preempted capture when torch fires.
- Persistence (SQLite) for v2 store.
- Real calendar sync replacing the seeded `ItemOccurrence`.
- Selector-based subscriptions instead of `useV2Store()` in components.
- macOS Notification permission UX: handle the first-launch prompt gracefully.
- Notarization for production system notifications.

## Resume instructions

If this session is interrupted, the next session should:

1. Read this file top to bottom.
2. Look at the **Status pointer** line — that is the next concrete action.
3. Read `src/shared/domain-v2.ts` for the contract.
4. Read whichever step files were last touched (`git status`).
5. Continue from the marked step.
6. Update the Status pointer before doing other work.
